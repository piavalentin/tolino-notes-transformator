#### ðŸš§ working draft ðŸš§

If you're like me and tag a lot of words you don't know while reading ebooks - this will help you actually go through your notes. I need it for English - German (as seen in the script): find synonyms, and translations. Since the `googletrans` (Google Translate API) library is not performing really well with translations, I also translate their synonyms. (This can be adjusted to use DeepL or Google Cloud Translation API)

#### TODO
- implement sentences handling (`extract_words`)
- check for 0 as unlimited synonyms (`find_synonyms`)
