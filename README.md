### ‚ö†Ô∏è working draft ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you're like me and mark a lot of words you don't know while reading ebooks - this will help you actually go through your notes.

I need if for English: find synonyms, and translations. 
Since the `googletrans` library is not performing really well with translations, I also translate their synonyms. This can be adjusted to use DeepL or Google Cloud Translation API.
